## HEPA filters
I've done some research into HEPA filters.   I think it's not entirely clear at the moment whether SARS-Cov-2 is communicable only by droplets or also by aeresolized droplet nuclei, but HEPA should reduce droplets and would probably reduce droplet nuclei extremely well.
Attached figure is from a NASA study on using HEPA filters to reduce submicron and nanoparticulate matter.  See the graph on page 7.
- HEPA filters = filter 99.95% of .3µm (microns) and up
- Droplet nuclei: 1-5µm
- respirable droplets = <10 µm
- inspirable droplets = 10–100 µm

# Preparation
- consider a [portable bidet](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=portable+bidet&s=review-rank&ref=sr_st_review-rank) instead of toilet paper
## masks
- evidence suggests that since the general public isn’t trained on how to properly wear or dispose of fitted masks (N95)
- the benefit of wearing one is low (unless you are around the infected)
- the CDC doesn’t recommend it
- anything to keep you from touching your mouth/noses/eyes is good though
## handwashing
- [WHO on handwashing](https://www.who.int/gpsc/clean_hands_protection/en/)
- [CDC handwashing](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html)
## surface disinfectants
See [CDC disinfection guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html).

The [list of EPA approved Disinfectants for Use Against SARS-CoV-2](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2) is, in general, sold out on Amazon.  However, you can look up the same ingredients in other formulations.  In particular, quaternary ammonium is available in tablet form and seems generally more portable than other ingredients.

Get a spray bottle (glass for bleach, dark glass for H2O2) and spray something like this:
- 70% ethanol
- 70% isopropyl alcohol (higher % is less effective due to reduced dwell time)
- 0.1% sodium hypochlorite (bleach)
- 0.5% hydrogen peroxide (still readily available)
